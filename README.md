# Github-branching-strategy
A project on git ( a version control system ) explaining the best possible branching strategy for any team to adopt for their softwares.


- **Master branch**: This branch handles production deployments.

- **Feature branch**: This branch is used for developing new features during a sprint (it will be merged with the main branch once the feature is successfully implemented).

- **Release branch**: This branch is used for higher environments (QA/STAGE), where the code is tested but not used in production.

- **Develop branch**: This branch manages the changes made by developers in their own branches.

- **Hotfix branch**: This branch addresses production-related issues, such as bug fixes after a release. It is used for resolving such issues.
